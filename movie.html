                    <h1>Movies with Chuck</h1>
                    <p>Carlos Ray "Chuck" Norris (born March 10, 1940) is an American martial artist and
                        actor. After serving in the United States Air Force, he began his rise to fame as a martial
                        artist and has since founded his own school, Chun Kuk Do. As a result of his "tough guy" image,
                        an Internet phenomenon began in 2005 known as Chuck Norris facts, ascribing various implausible
                        or even impossible feats to Norris. Norris appeared in a number of action films, such as Way of
                        the Dragon in which he starred alongside Bruce Lee and was The Cannon Group's leading star in
                        the 1980s. He next played the starring role in the television series Walker, Texas Ranger from
                        1993 to 2001. In 2008, he campaigned for former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who was running for the
                        Republican nomination for President in 2008.</p>

                        <p>Fact of the day: The easiest way to determine Chuck Norris's age is to cut him in half and
                            count the rings. (Norris commented: "Three years ago, at the end of a Nightline interview,
                            ABC host Bill Weir asked me my age and I told him 66. Then I added with a smile, 'I like to
                            say I'm 39, with 27 years of experience.'")</p>
